# Creating a Binary Classification Model to Predict Nonvoting

## Introduction 
The aim of this project is to build a binary classification model for predicting whether an eligible voter did not vote in the 2016 presidential election. 
It will use a selection of data from the [2018 General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/). 
Past research has suggested that socioeconomic variables such as education, wealth, and occupation are strong predictors of voter turnout. Features in this subset include a variety of socioeconomic variables, as well as variables related to respondents' political attitudes. 

The ability to predict if an eligible voter did not vote can be used to increase overall voter turnout in future elections. Organizations that engage eligible voters to increase turnout might choose to prioritize individuals who are less likely to vote, given that those who are likely to vote may do so without outreach.

It is important to note that any model designed to predict human behavior is inherently limited, in that an individual's attitudes, motivations and circumstances can change within a given period of timeâ€”and especially over the course of an entire preseidential term. 
Furthermore, there is a diversity of views about the value and efficacy of voting, and some eligible voters may abstatin from it on principle. 
This project does not assume that every non-voter can or should choose to vote, but is instead intented to serve only as a guideline for voter engagement organizations that are interested in focusing on non-voters.
